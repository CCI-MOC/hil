# This is an example configuration file for HaaS. The HaaS will read its
# configuration from a file called ``haas.cfg``, in the current working
# directory. To get started, you may simply copy this file, and modify as
# needed.
#
# If you're using this locally and not actually deploying changes, this file can
# be used as-is. Otherwise, you'll likely need to adjust the settings for your
# particular configuration.
#
# the options under [client] are required for making client-side requests with
# the cli tool (anything but haas serve). Switch specific options are mandatory
# if and only if that switch driver is in use. The database section is needed to
# run the server at all, while the remaining options can be ommited if
# project_deploy is never invoked (or the dry_run option is enabled).

[general]
# The driver to use for the network switch. The value must be the name of one of
# the modules in haas.drivers:
active_switch = dell

[headnode]
# The trunked network interface on the host. This is the nic that the VMs will
# be bridged to to gain access to their networks.
trunk_nic = eth0

[client]
# The http endpoint that the client should talk to 
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:5000

[database]
# A SQLAlchemy database URI, specifying the database for the server to connect to.
uri = sqlite:///haas.db

[switch dell]
# Settings specific to the dell powerconnect driver. Other switches might have
# sections for their own options.

# The ip address that the switch's console is listening on.
ip = 192.168.0.2
# Login credetials, fairly self-explanatory:
user = foo
pass = bar

vlans = 100-109
# Another valid list:  14,35-40, 100-900, 904, 65-85

# A handful of functions which touch external state (start vms, communicate with
# swithces...) can be disabled for development purposes. When this is done, the
# calls to the function will be logged, but not actually executed. to do this,
# uncomment the following:
#
#[devel]
#dry_run=
