# This is an example configuration file for HaaS developers.  It enables debug
# output, points client operations to the default port used by "haas serve"
# (5000) and utilizes a sqlite DB in the current directory. Note that this
# still requires a real network switch and real hardware nodes to operate
# against. For a configuration that removes the need for real hardware by
# supressing hardware operations, see ``haas.cfg.dev-no-hardware``.
#
# The ``haas`` command will read its  configuration from a file called
# ``haas.cfg``, in the current working directory. The ``haas.wsgi`` script will
# look for it at ``/etc/haas.cfg``. This will change in the future; it isn't
# considered reasonable behavior.
#
# The comments in this file are targeted at developers; Take a look at haas.cfg
# for something more production/end-user oriented.
#
# The options under [client] are required for making client-side requests with
# the cli tool (anything but ``haas serve`` or ``haas serve_networks``). Driver
# specific options are mandatory if and only if that driver is in use.  The
# database section is needed to run the server at all, while the remaining
# options can be omitted if the dry_run option is enabled.

[general]
# The driver to use for networking operations. This should be the name of a
# module in ``haas.drivers``. You'll also need to set  corresponding options in
# the driver specific section (i.e. ``[driver ${your_driver}]``).  Note that
# either the ``null`` or ``null_vlan`` driver can be used in testing and
# development to keep HaaS from trying to access a real switch.
driver = simple_vlan

# How verbosely to log.  Log messages of the given severity or more will be
# logged.  Options include: debug, info, warn/warning, error, critical/fatal.
log_level = debug

[headnode]
# The trunk NIC on the host. This is the nic that the VMs will be bridged to
# to gain access to their networks. See INSTALL.rst for more information.
trunk_nic = eth0

# Names of base headnode instances (as a comma separated list). These are
# VM instances within libvirt, which should be powered off, that can be
# cloned to create a headnode.
base_imgs = img1, img2, img3, img4

# The libvirt instance to connect to this *needs* to be a system instance for
# the haas to work -- user sessions provide too little networking functionality
# to support HaaS. If you're running the HaaS API Server on the same machine as
# libvirt the value below is correct. While running it on a separate host should
# be possible, it is untested.
libvirt_endpoint = qemu:///system

[client]
# Options used by the ``haas`` command line tool on the client side.

# The http endpoint that the command line tool should connect to. The server
# doesn't use this; it must be configured separately. To double check that you
# have the right value, make sure the API server is running, and execute::
# 
#   haas list_free_nodes
#
# from within the directory containing haas.cfg.
#
# The default below will be correct if the API Server was launched with the
# ``haas serve`` command.
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:5000

[database]
# A SQLAlchemy database URI, specifying the database for the server to
# connect to. At present, only sqlite is supported. The example below is a
# relative path, which looks for the database in the current directory.
uri = sqlite:///haas.db
#uri = postgresql://<username>:<password>@<address>/<dbname>

[driver simple_vlan]
# Driver specific settings for the ``simple_vlan`` driver.

# A JSON object describing the switch. The specific fields are:
# "switch" -- the type of switch. Right now, the only meaningful value is
#             ``dell``, which indicates a Dell Powerconnect 5500 series switch.
#
# "ip" -- the ip address to connect to (via telnet, on the standard port 23).
# "user" -- the user to log in as
# "pass" -- the password to log in with
#
# You will *definitely* need to change this -- if you're unsure of the correct
# values, please ask your local system administrator.
switch = {"switch": "dell", "ip": "192.168.0.1", "user": "foo", "pass": "bar"}

[vlan]
# VLANs available for use for allocation by the driver. This is a
# comma-separated list of individual VLAN numbers or ranges, e.g::
#
#   vlans = 14,35-40, 100-900, 904, 65-85
#
# When running the deployment tests, a smaller number of VLANs may be
# desirable, as it reduces running time substantially. A minumum of four VLANs
# are required.
vlans = 100-109

[devel]
# A handful of functions which touch external state (start vms, communicate with
# swithces...) can be disabled for development purposes. When this is done, the
# calls to the function will be logged, but not actually executed. To do this,
# uncomment the following:
#
# dry_run=True
