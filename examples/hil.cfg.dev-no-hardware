# # Below is a reasoanble configuration *for development*. It is not suitable
# # for production, If for no other reason than because it forces plaintext
# # (non-TLS) connections to keystone:
# auth_url = http://127.0.0.1:35357/v3

# Depending on what you're trying to do, you may want to use the vlan_pool
# network allocator instead of the null allocator. To do this, comment out the
# null allocator extension above, and uncomment the following:
#
# hil.ext.network_allocators.vlan_pool =
#
#[hil.ext.network_allocators.vlan_pool]
#vlans = 100-200, 300-500
